**Differences in Code Between Stack and Queue**
Removing Elements (Stack’s pop() vs. Queue’s popleft()):
In the stack, pop() removes from the end of the deque (top of the stack).
In the queue, popleft() removes from the beginning of the deque (front of the queue).
Principle of Operation:
Stack: Last In, First Out (LIFO) – last added item is removed first.
Queue: First In, First Out (FIFO) – first added item is removed first.
