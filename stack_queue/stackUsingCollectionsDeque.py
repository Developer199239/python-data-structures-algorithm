# LIFO=>Last in first out

# In Python, the collections.deque (double-ended queue) is a data structure from the collections module. Itâ€™s optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends of the queue, making it ideal for implementing a stack or queue.

# What is collections.deque
# deque is a generalization of stacks and queues.
# It allows appending and popping from both ends in constant time.
# It's more efficient than a Python list for inserting and deleting elements from the front of the collection.
