# Queue (FIFO: First-In, First-Out)
# Definition: A structure where the first item added is the first to be removed.

# Use When: Elements need to be processed in the order they arrived.

# Operations:

# Enqueue: Add an item to the end.
# Dequeue: Remove the item from the front.
# Peek: View the front item without removing it.
# Real-World Examples:

# Customer Service Lines: The first customer in line is served first.
# Print Queue: Documents are printed in the order theyâ€™re added to the queue.
# Task Scheduling: Tasks are processed in the order they are queued, useful in CPU scheduling.


# FIFo first in first out
# (first)1<-2<-3<-(last)
# insert(enqueue) 4
# (first)1<-2<-3<-4<-(last)
# dequeue will 1(first in first out) 
# (first)2<-3<-4(last)
